		<h3>Someting about my videos....</h3>
    <p>I love to upload and edit the videos. I usually give voiceovers to my videos in which I don't do a face-cam.

<p>Now many people ask me in the comment section that how do I edit my videos and which app do I use? So I use Inshot for editing and also sometimes use Youtube Studio Video Editor to edit my videos. I can't really explain how exactly I edit the videos because it is a lot of work.</p>

<br>
        <p>I also love to make videos whenever I am free. I hate to sit free without any work.</p>
		<p>I usually try to make videos that are requested by my viewers. I also read the comments. Please tell me all your suggestions and reviews in the video comments. I read them and I will always try to improve my videos and also I will like and love your comment if I feel so. I will also upload a few Bites in here which will not be available on Youtube. In those I will tell about my future video updates and also a few small experiments which are not worth a video. I will also upload them on Youtube in compilation of a few more videos. Thanks a lot for visiting my  website.</p>
